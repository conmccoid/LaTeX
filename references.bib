abstract = "Spectral collocation methods have become very useful in providing highly accurate solutions to differential equations. A straightforward implementation of these methods involves the use of spectral differentiation matrices. To obtain optimal accuracy these matrices must be computed carefully. We demonstrate that naive algorithms for computing these matrices suffer from severe loss of accuracy due to roundoff errors. Several improvements are analyzed and compared. A number of numerical examples are provided, demonstrating significant differences between the sensitivity of the forward problem and the inverse problem.",

abstract = "In this paper, we discuss the parameter-uniform finite difference method for a coupled system of singularly perturbed convectionâ€“diffusion equations. The leading term of each equation is multiplied by a small but different magnitude positive parameter, which leads to the overlap and interact boundary layer. We analyze the boundary layer and construct a piecewise-uniform mesh on the variant of the Shishkin mesh. We prove that our schemes converge almost first-order uniformly with respect to small parameters. We present some numerical experiments to support our theoretical analysis.",

abstract = "A novel collocation method for a coupled system of singularly perturbed linear equations is presented. This method is based on rational spectral collocation method in barycentric form with sinh transform. By sinh transform, the original Chebyshev points are mapped into the transformed ones clustered near the singular points of the solution. The results from asymptotic analysis about the singularity solution are employed to determine the parameters in this sinh transform. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of our method.",

abstract = "Boundary conditions in spectral collocation methods are typically imposed by removing some rows of the discretized differential operator and replacing them with others that enforce the required conditions at the boundary. A new approach based upon resampling differentiated polynomials into a lower-degree subspace makes differentiation matrices, and operators built from them, rectangular without any row deletions. Then, boundary and interface conditions can be adjoined to yield a square system. The resulting method is both flexible and robust, and avoids ambiguities that arise when applying the classical row deletion method outside of two-point scalar boundary-value problems. The new method is the basis for ordinary differential equation solutions in Chebfun software, and is demonstrated for a variety of boundary-value, eigenvalue and time-dependent problems.",

We introduce here a new effective procedure based on coordinate stretching and the Chebyshev pseudospectral method to resolve the boundary layers. Stable and accurate results are obtained for very thin boundary layers with a fairly small number of spectral collocation points.",

abstract = {A spectral collocation method based on rational interpolants and adaptive grid points is presented. The rational interpolants approximate analytic functions with exponential accuracy by using prescribed barycentric weights and transformed Chebyshev points. The locations of the grid points are adapted to singularities of the underlying solution, and the locations of these singularities are approximated by the locations of poles of ChebyshevPad approximants. Numerical experiments on two timedependent problems, one with finite time blowup and one with a moving front, indicate that the method far outperforms the standard Chebyshev spectral collocation method for problems whose solutions have singularities in the complex plane close to $[-1,1]$.},

abstract = {The Lagrange representation of the interpolating polynomial can be rewritten in two more computationally attractive forms: a modified Lagrange form and a barycentric form. We give an error analysis of the evaluation of the interpolating polynomial using these two forms. The modified Lagrange formula is shown to be backward stable. The barycentric formula has a less favourable error analysis, but is forward stable for any set of interpolating points with a small Lebesgue constant. Therefore the barycentric formula can be significantly less accurate than the modified Lagrange formula only for a poor choice of interpolating points. This analysis provides further weight to the argument of Berrut and Trefethen that barycentric Lagrange interpolation should be the polynomial interpolation method of choice.},
